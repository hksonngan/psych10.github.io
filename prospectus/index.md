## Overview of the course

We are currently revising the syllabus for a fully online version of the course to be given in Winter 2021.  Please check back later for more details.

**Rationale**: It is impossible to understand the modern world without an understanding of statistics.  From public opinion polls to clinical trials in medicine to online systems that recommend purchases to us, statistics play a role in nearly every aspect of our lives. The goal of this course is to provide an understanding of the essential concepts and “big ideas” of statistics --- describing data and making decisions and predictions based on data -- as well as the skills to employ these concepts on real data to solve authentic problems. At the end of the course, students will possess:
- *Statistical literacy*: The ability to dissect and understand statistical claims in scientific research and popular media
- *Statistical ability*: The skills necessary to apply statistical analysis methods to real data
- *Statistical curiosity*: The interest in further developing their statistical skills and knowledge, and the confidence in their ability to do so

**Instructional philosophy**.  My instructional philosophy is based on the overwhelming scientific evidence that the standard instructional model  (a lecturer talking at students for a long period) is an ineffective way to instill lasting skills and knowledge.  Instead, I will aim for the course to be:
- *Active*: The classroom experience should be more like a conversation than a one-directional transmission of information.
- *Evidence-based*: Frequent assessments will provide the instructors with ongoing information about student learning, so that we can base the progression of the course on data rather than subjective impressions.
- *Authentic*: We will engage with real data in all its messiness using real statistical tools, with the goal of learning how to solve real problems and how to avoid common missteps and pitfalls.

Statistics is a broad field, and the goal of this course is not “coverage” of the entire field or simple familiarity with the concepts. Instead, we will work towards a deep understanding and ability to apply a set of core concepts, and we will actively adjust the course based on the results from our daily assessments.
